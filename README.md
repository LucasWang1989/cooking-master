# cooking-master

Cooking Master is a recipe app that is based on my assignment. This project includes a front end and a back end.  
The app is implemented by using the React Native framework, and the backend server is implemented by using Java and Spring. 
This app implements features such as popular recipe recommendation, graphic and textual recipes, video recipes, 
regional dishes, recipe details, integrated AI tool ChatGPT for recipe recommendation, the fuzzy query of recipes, 
search history, and adding favourite recipes. It can register new users, adding and displaying new recipes through the server. 
This app has all the essential functions required for recipe apps, enabling interaction between the server and the app.

The frontend app has been published on Huawei Appgallery: https://appgallery.huawei.com/app/C108562169.
The backend server is running on AWS, and its source code can be found here: https://github.com/LucasWang1989/cms
